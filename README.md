# Basic-Calculator
This Basic calculator uses HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to do basic math like add, subtract, multiply, and divide. It has large, clear buttons arranged neatly using a grid layout. The app calculates answers using JavaScript’s eval() function on the input. And it helps to learn how web and JS work together.
